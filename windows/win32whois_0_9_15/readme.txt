2. Files/Registry keys used:
----------------------------
o Win32Whois does not store any settings in the registry.
o Win32Whois uses INI file to store it's settings. The INI file will automatically
  be created in Users Profile directory under Application Data\Gena01\win32whois.
  Note: If you create an empty win32whois.ini file in the same directory as win32whois.exe,
		then it will use this one instead. (For removable media and archiving)

				* * *

3. Troubleshooting:
-------------------
o First of all check to see that you have the latest version of Win32Whois. Then
  look in the forums to see if it has been reported yet, and if there is a fix
  or a solution to your problem. (See web links in the beginning of this file)

o Win32Whois uses riched20.dll. This DLL is available on most of the current
  versions of Windows. This DLL is also installed and used by various Microsoft
  programs.

o If you think that you found a bug then please report it to me so that I could
  fix it. (Contact information is in the beginning of this file)
