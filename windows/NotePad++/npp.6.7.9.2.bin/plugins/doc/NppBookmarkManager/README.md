## Introduction ##
This plugin adds simple bookmark functionality to Notepad++. 
Basically it provides shortcuts for defining / jumping to specific bookmarks as it is incorporated in many RAD tools.

Head for the download section (https://bitbucket.org/ViRuSTriNiTy/nppbookmarkmanager/downloads) to grab the latest build and copy the files from the ZIP archive to the Notepad++ plugin directory (by default this is %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Notepad++\plugins). You should see a new entry named "Bookmark Manager" in the "Plugins" menu after restarting Notepad++.

Feel free to file issues by using the Issue Tracker (https://bitbucket.org/ViRuSTriNiTy/nppbookmarkmanager/issues).
