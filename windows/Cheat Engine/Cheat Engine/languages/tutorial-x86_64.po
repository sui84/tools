"If the assembler instruction has a calculation (e.g: [esi+12]) at the end then type the value in that's at the end. else \n"
"leave it 0. If it was a more complicated instruction look at the calculation.\n"
"\n"
"example of a more complicated instruction:\n"
"[EAX*2+EDX+00000310] eax=4C and edx=00801234.\n"
"In this case EDX would be the value the pointer has, and EAX*2+00000310 the offset, so the offset you'd fill in \n"

"you'll find will also be a pointer. You just have to find out the pointer to that pointer exactly the same way as you did \n"
