Wordfile changes for syntax highlighting:

UE has defaults for Open and Close Brace Strings for many languages.
If no strings are specified in the Wordfile, the defaults are used. 
Otherwise, the specified strings are used are used for brace matching.

/Open Brace Strings = "("
/Close Brace Strings = ")"


UE has defaults for Open and Close Fold Strings for many languages.
If no strings are specified in the Wordfile, the defaults are used.
Otherwise, the specified strings are used are used for folding.

/Open Fold Strings = "{"
/Close Fold Strings = "}"


UE has defaults for Multi-line string highlighting capability for
many languages.  If no strings are specified in the Wordfile, the
defaults are used.  Otherwise, one of the following strings may be
added to the language definition line (i.e., /L8 PHP ...)

EnableMLS
DisableMLS


UE has improved syntax highlighting and it now supports multiple 
languages within a single file.  This is specifically for HTML type 
files.  To help facilitate this, we have added additional language 
indicators that should be added to the wordfile.txt file to indicate the 
type of language for any languages that may be included within another. 
Our default wordfile has these modifications.

Example:
If an HTML file includes PHP then the syntax highlighting section must 
exist in the main wordfile and the PHP section should include in the 
definition line: PHP_LANG

Unambiguous language markers have been added to the default wordfile for
the following languages:

C_LANG               // C/C++
COBOL_LANG           // Cobol
FORTRAN_LANG         // Fortran
PASCAL_LANG          // Pascal
PERL_LANG            // Perl
PLB_LANG             // Plb
VB_LANG              // Visual Basic
VBSCRIPT_LANG        // Vb Script
ASP_LANG             // ASP
CSHARP_LANG          // C Sharp
CSS_LANG             // CSS
LATEX_LANG           // TeX / LaTeX
HTML_LANG            // HTML
JAVA_LANG            // Java
JSCRIPT_LANG         // Javascript
ECMA_LANG            // Ecma / Ecmascript
PHP_LANG             // PHP
PYTHON_LANG          // Python
XML_LANG             // XML
XSL_LANG             // XSL
MATLAB_LANG          // Matlab script
MASM_LANG            // Microsoft Assembler
AASM_LANG            // AT&T Assembler
NASM_LANG            // Netwide Assembler

Currently, UE uses the above language markers to correctly highlight
multiple languages within a file.  In the future UE may make further
use of these languages markers in the wordfile.

Note that if your wordfile contains multiple occurrences of the HTML_LANG
language marker, this must be corrected or some languages may not
highlight correctly.  UE allows only one instance of a language marker
(i.e., C_LANG, COBOL_LANG, HTML_LANG) in a wordfile.

The following file extensions were moved to the HTML section of the
default wordfile: php, asp, and jsp.  This was done to facilitate correct
HTML highlighting at the outer language level of the file even when no
<HTML> language tag is specified within the file.  All php, asp, and jsp
sections of the files are highlighted correctly based on language start
and end tags (<? and ?> for example), however a "View As" will show the
file as HTML type.
